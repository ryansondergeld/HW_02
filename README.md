## Description
- This application has (3) SeekBars that control RGB (red, green blue) color values.  
- Moving the sliders adjusts the background color and updates the RGB values as well as the HEX representation of the combined (3) SeekBars.
- Depending on the color generated the text color will automatically adjust to Black or White to be legible.
- By clicking the 'add' button the value in the background will be added to a list that contains the RGB and HEX representation.
- Clicking on any of the colors in the list view will load the color into the slider bars.
